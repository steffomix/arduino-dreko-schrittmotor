# Channel Calculation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Steps Per Channel Calculation
**Problem**: The steps per channel was manually entered and could lead to inconsistencies.

**Solution**: 
- Made steps per channel automatically calculated from the calibration positions (Channel 41 and Channel 40)
- Changed the GUI field to read-only with label "Schritte/Kanal (berechnet)"
- Formula: `steps_per_channel = abs(ch40_pos - ch41_pos) / 79`
- Rationale: There are 79 channel steps between channel 41 and channel 40 (40 channels 41-80, plus 39 channels 1-39)

### 2. Channel Rounding and Snapping
**Problem**: Channel calculation wasn't properly snapping to the nearest channel when position updates occurred.

**Solution**:
- Improved the `calculate_channel_from_position()` method with proper bounds checking
- Added index clamping to ensure valid range (0-79)
- Used proper rounding with `round()` function for better snapping behavior

### 3. Position Synchronization
**Problem**: Channel display would change after movement completion due to position drift.

**Solution**:
- Updated position parsing to save configuration when position updates occur
- Ensured consistent channel calculation using the same calculated steps per channel
- Added automatic configuration saving when position is updated from Arduino

## Code Changes Made

### Configuration Class
1. **New Method**: `get_calculated_steps_per_channel()`
   - Calculates steps per channel from calibration positions
   - Returns 30.0 as fallback if positions are identical

2. **Updated Method**: `calculate_channel_from_position()`
   - Uses calculated steps per channel instead of stored value
   - Added proper bounds checking and index clamping
   - Improved rounding behavior

3. **Updated Method**: `calculate_channel_position()`
   - Uses calculated steps per channel for consistency

### GUI Updates
1. **Steps Per Channel Field**: 
   - Changed to read-only (`state="readonly"`)
   - Updated label to "Schritte/Kanal (berechnet)"
   - Shows calculated value with 2 decimal places

2. **Calibration Methods**:
   - `set_channel_41_position()` and `set_channel_40_position()` now update the calculated steps display
   - `save_calibration()` simplified to only validate position difference
   - Added automatic steps per channel calculation and display update

3. **Position Updates**:
   - `parse_arduino_response()` now saves configuration when position updates
   - `load_settings()` displays calculated steps per channel

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All channel calculations use the same calculated steps per channel value
2. **Accuracy**: Eliminates manual entry errors for steps per channel
3. **Automatic Calibration**: Steps per channel automatically adjusts based on actual measured positions
4. **Proper Snapping**: Channel display snaps correctly to nearest channel position
5. **Persistent Settings**: Position and channel updates are automatically saved

## Testing

The fixes ensure:
- Channel calculations are consistent between position-to-channel and channel-to-position conversions
- GUI displays calculated steps per channel as read-only information
- Position updates from Arduino properly update and save the current channel
- Manual channel changes work correctly with the automatic calculations

## Usage

1. **Calibration Process**:
   - Move to channel 41 position and click "Aktuelle Position als Kanal 41 setzen"
   - Move to channel 40 position and click "Aktuelle Position als Kanal 40 setzen"
   - Click "Kalibrierung speichern"
   - The "Schritte/Kanal (berechnet)" field will automatically show the calculated value

2. **Normal Operation**:
   - Channel up/down buttons will move to the correct positions
   - Position updates will correctly calculate and display the current channel
   - All calculations are automatically consistent and accurate
